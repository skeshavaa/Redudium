# Redudium

This is my grade 12 computer science final project. It's a medieval adventure based game built in Unity. I was responsible for creating the various maps by using various assets
from different libraries as well as coding enemy behaviour and fight mechanics.

This project was built in collaboration with:
* Rishan Ratnasivam
* Sathursan Santhirakumar
